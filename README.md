# SenPY
SenPY - A CLI based anime downloader purely written in python [Based on GoGoAnime :)]

Uploaded the code and released a build for now. I'll be updating the README and usage info soon.
If you are restless until then, download the release. Also download the external dependency "aria2" from their github repo's release.
Run the program and update the config file and just download and binge the animes. 
I would suggest waiting for me to update this repo. :)

Notes for myself: 
- Fix aria2 call in code, forgot to use the dedicated location.
- Generate next onefile build taking care of icon file in temp directory
- Update readme, version, tag to create a new release
